Erlang parallel building blocks


ALPHA QUALITY SOFTWARE - NOT TESTED.


Somtimes we need to start multiple parallal tasks
and then wait until all of them completes.

This is acomplished using epbb module,
with new_group/0, spawn/2, spawn_list/2, go/1, async_go/1,
and sync/1 functions:

Example:

P = self(),
Group = epbb2:new_group(),
Group1 = epbb2:spawn_list([
                 fun() -> io:format("A~n"), epbb2:barrier(), io:format("K~n") end,
                 fun() -> io:format("B~n"), epbb2:barrier(), io:format("L~n") end,
                 fun() -> io:format("C~n"), epbb2:barrier(), io:format("M~n") end
            ], Group),
Group2 = epbb2:spawn(fun() -> io:format("D~n"), epbb2:barrier(), io:format("N~n") end, Group1),
{Group3, goed} = epbb2:go(Group2),
{_, synced} = epbb2:sync(Group3),
io:format("Z~n").


It will display A, B, C, D before K, L, M, N which will be before Z.
Actuall A, B, C, D can be permuted. Similary K, L, M, N.
But ordering beetween groups will be conserved.

For example on my machine it output gives:

C
B
A
D
N
K
L
M
Z
ok



There are two identical APIs which can be used.
epbb and epbb2, they just differ in implementation.

epbb is based on direct handling of processes
in sync function in calling processes.

epbb2 starts new controling processes in new_group, and all
other calls are actually just sending messages
to this controling process. It is more flexible,
more robust and should be faster, if you have multiple
groups, or want to perform something in the calling
processes without worring about usage of barriers in
spawned processes.


Spawned tasks, can perform currently actions:
   - epbb2:barrier() - must be called by all spawned processes
               to make progress through it
   - epbb2:iamdone() - called automatically when processes ends


TODO:
   - reduce
   - broadcast_to_other
   - send_to_parent
   - receive_from_parent

   % two last functions involves parent to communicate with all processes,
   % this means that all spawned processes should follow same
   % code path.
